A feast which takes you outside and is still just around the corner. A bit of escapism while at the same time confronting the challenges of reality.",
    "text2": "We are the Team Tarmac, friends, family, acquaintances and strangers, crew, the curious, the creative, artists and musicians from near and far: Halle and Leipzig, Jena and Berlin, and many more locations from far and wide. We are ready for this! For four days, we want to create an atmosphere with you in which we develop open spaces, self-actualize, and be at ease. The creation process is already part of the goal we are working towards, even though we are uncertain of when it will be achieved. The Tarmac Festival does not convey just one vision; the people who make this project possible are too diverse for this. ",

It turned out that the individual collectives had already perceived each other but rarely organized joint events, also because the diverse musical orientations did not make the process seem evident at first.",
      "text2": "We agreed that the realization of the project would be particularly successful if we can motivate the already active collectives in Halle and the wider vicinity to become part of an idea. In 2018 we started introducing ourselves as Team Tarmac to the different collectives. We took part in plenary sessions, built a network consisting of various sectors of art and music, and helped to realize open-air raves and other events.",
      "text3": "At the end of 2018 we had the first talks with the operators of the Allstedt airfield. Good to have landed here: a stretch of forest and concrete. An inspiring airfield ruin. A tarmac that extends to the horizon, close to Halle and Leipzig. Practically reachable by train and bike. In short: The ideal location for us.",
      "text4": "In 2019 the cooperation was a done deal. This was followed by the continuous use of an aircraft hangar and a lot of work input to make the area suitable for the festival in 2020.",

This showed us what it means to make a project of this size come true through voluntary work, self-determination and self-financing. Your coming gave us strength and confirmation to pursue a real goal with our visions."
